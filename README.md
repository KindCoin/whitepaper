# KindCoin WhitePaper

## Introduction
"Reliable and secure financial transactions for the sake of good and development - this is what will move humanity forward to development"
Blockchain is spreading in a wide range of applications and is firmly included in the everyday life of all mankind
Decentralization and reliability are what makes this tool attractive to all people from politicians to specialists at all levels.
This is what prompted us to think about the sphere of charity and investment, since the spheres have huge holes in security, reliability and transparency.
 In this document, you can find comprehensive data on current financing and investment schemes, analytics of gross financial flows, problems of implementing algorithms for the platform's work, solutions that close all the shortcomings of classical models, and as a result of the principle of global unification. financial instruments in the KindCoin decentralized platform
 
## Sphere of charity
The largest known organization. A system for managing large-scale work around the world. personnel structure. That is, the decision to help or not to help, where to send funds, in what amount depends on the 25 people of the head council.
For centuries, this is the only way to organize and direct its activities in the right direction, but technology does not stand still, of course, this should contribute to the system of charity and assistance and to countries.
Also, huge administrative resources require huge financial support, which is charged in the form of not small 7% of donations.

## Investment area
At the moment, there are quite a few sites on the network for launching startups, each of them has its own conditions, pros and cons, from the share of the project, to just financial support for the benefit of development. The sphere is quite developed due to the fact that the lion's share of projects falls on IT and new technologies, web development and automation. But even in it, investors are faced with problems of transparency and security, which are used purposefully for the project or will be used for other purposes, does the investor use the profit from the project, who is responsible for the success of the project? In the field of investment, you always want to understand the payback periods, project roadmap, development plan and market entry. Unfortunately, this is normal for investing in general. Questions and make the system completely transparent and understandable even for novice agents

## Taxation and other aspects
We have a tax of 0.1 percent on every transaction. This tax goes to the maintenance of the token and the infrastructure deployed around it. We do not deduct any taxes and fees on either exchange or cashing.
 
## Difficulties in implementation
What we face when we work with charity and investment
* Non-transparency - in most cases, the data is not disclosed, when and in what way the funds are transferred, when they are fully allocated, and whether they are used for their intended purpose.
* Banking rules - restrictions on transfers, confirmation of the intended purpose of the payment, checks for the legality of financing, commission for transfers, de-anonymity in transactions - this is a small part of the complexities of the classical banking system
* Insecurity of confidential data - unfortunately, it is not a secret for us that all our personal data are, de facto, confidential data.

## Blockchain application in spheres
Now let's imagine the perfect picture of the investment and philanthropy industry.
All data is anonymous if desired
All transactions are tracked to their intended purpose with the provision of facts of use
The whole system is decentralized and managed by a huge number of users, not allowing several people to unilaterally manage the system in their own interests
There are no restrictions on the use of your funds, no one can prohibit you from using the amount of finance that you yourself want
Low transaction fees to maintain the network, you do not need to maintain a staff of management personnel, everything is automated
Absolute transparency of activities, any user can check the use of their and common resources at any convenient time
A collective decision, users independently decide which project is worthy of reward, which country now needs help in the first place, which issues require immediate intervention
And all this happens in your mobile phone or laptop, now, in real time
 
 
## How the QC platform works
The platform must meet all the requirements of decentralization and anonymity
The platform uses the following concepts:
Personal account - an anonymous user interface at will, with a connected wallet, a means of purchasing and withdrawing CDS, a list of supported funding objects
Personal account - user account for storing fiat funds and for storing CDS token
General account - an aggregate account replenished voluntarily by users, to support startups and charity by the results of a general vote, the general account can be replenished with any amount from $ 10 or the equivalent in CDS, each replenished account has the right to vote in support of projects, the general account has a public wallet address and is open for anyone who wants to view it, all transactions from this wallet are sent only to supported projects that won the voting of users, the project receives funds only after providing supporting documents on the intended use of funds
Voting - voting takes place on all projects available in the system, the voting system allows users to independently choose the object of financing from the funds of the common account, users who have contributed to the accumulation of the common account can take part in the voting
Participation in the project share - if the application is submitted by a startup with the possibility of the investor's participation in the project share, the investor can take advantage of this opportunity and include himself in the list of project founders, after financing the investor becomes a full-fledged founder of the project and claims an agreed share of the project's profit
Project buyout offer - projects applying for financing can sell the project upon receipt of such an offer from the investor on the site, in which case the project becomes fully owned by the investor
Application - an application for funding is submitted by any person, organization, start-up, it contains comprehensive data, photo video materials or a presentation of the project with financial indicators * you can read more about the placement rules in the FAK
Buying and selling CDS through the platform - no commissions are charged
To resolve the issue of fairness in the distribution of resources, we use a majority voting system, where the minimum threshold of the total number of users should be at least 51%
If the number of votes is not set, the system automatically selects the option that has received the largest number of the available ones.
